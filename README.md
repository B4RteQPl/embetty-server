[Embetty](https://github.com/heiseonline/embetty) displays remote content like tweets or YouTube videos without compromising your privacy. `embetty-server` acts as a proxy and provides the necessary data.

You may run the Embetty server in two different ways. Either you use our [official Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/heiseonline/embetty-server/) to run Embetty server in a container, or you install Embetty server on your server and use a process manager. In both variants you should configure a URL path of the target website in your web server so that requests are forwarded to the Embetty server (reverse proxy).

## Running Embetty server with Docker

The docker image exposes the server on port 8080. You may want to provide some of the environment variables listed in the table below. It is necessary that `VALID_ORIGINS` is specified. This variable must contain your origin(s) or a simple `*` for any origin. If you want to display tweets with Embetty, you also need to define the four Twitter environment variables. You get the Twitter data by creating a [Twitter app](https://apps.twitter.com/).

```sh
$ docker run \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  --name embetty \
  --rm \
  -e VALID_ORIGINS=https://example.com \
  -e TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY=... \
  -e TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=... \
  -e TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY=... \
  -e TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET=... \
  heiseonline/embetty-server:latest
```

## Running Embetty server with a process manager

1. Install Embetty server by running `yarn global add @heise/embetty-server`. This makes the `embetty` command available on the server.
2. Setup a process manager like [Forever](https://github.com/foreverjs/forever), [PM2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2) or [StrongLoop Process Manager](http://strong-pm.io/). If you want to display tweets with Embetty, you also need to define the four Twitter environment variables (see the table below) in your process manager setup. You get the Twitter data by creating a [Twitter app](https://apps.twitter.com/).
3. Configure the Process manager to run `embetty start`. The command `bin/embetty start --help` prints a list of all supported options. You probably want to specify a custom port.

## Configuration

Embetty server is configured using the following environment variables.

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `DEBUG` | This variable controls the output of log messages. You may set it to `embetty.*` to log all Embetty messages to `STDOUT`. |
| `EMBETTY_CACHE`| Connection string of a cache adapter. Currently [Redis](https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/prov/redis) (example: `redis://`) and LRU (example: `lru://`) are supported. |
| `NODE_ENV` | This variable should be set to `production` in production environments. |
| `PORT` | This variable can be used to specify the port on which Embetty Server listens. Default: `3000` |
| `TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY` | Twitter Access Token |
| `TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` | Twitter Access Token Secret |
| `TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY` | Twitter consumer Key (API Key) |
| `TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET` | Twitter consumer Secret (API Secret) |
| `VALID_ORIGINS` | Contains a comma-separated list of allowed [origins](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Origin). Must be specified. Examples: `https://example.com`, `https://a.example.com,https://b.example.com` or `*`. |

## Testing the server setup

Test your setup by sending a request to the started server. If everything works out, JSON data and a status of 200 are returned.

```sh
$ curl -i http://localhost:8080/version
$ curl -i http://localhost:8080/tweet/985882036777955328
```
